  <h1>Technical rules</h1>
  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Only teams accepted by the Regional Contest Director can take part in the contest.</li>
    <li>All teams who want to participate have to check-in at the registration desk on Friday or on Saturday. A team cannot compete in the CERC if the participation fee is not paid in advance. No cash will be accepted during the registration.</li>
  </ol>
 
  
  <h2>Conduct of the contest</h2>
  <p class="paragraph"></p>
  <dl class="ordered">
    <ol>
    <li>All
      team members must attend all contest activities as specified in the
      schedule. The Coach is expected to attend or be available by phone
      during contest activities. Failure to attend any of the designated
      contest events can result in automatic disqualification and forfeiture
      of any prizes.</li>
    <li>At least six problems will be posed.
      So far as possible, problems will avoid dependence on detailed
      knowledge of a particular applications area or a particular contest
      language. However some knowledge of basic graph, text and geometric
      algorithms can be helpful. (A good source of such algorithms is the
      book ''Introduction to Algorithms, 2nd edition'' by Cormen, Leisserson,
      Rivest, and Stein.)</li>
    <li>The language of the contest is
      English. All written contest materials and all communications with
      contest officials will be in English.</li>
    <li>Contestants may
      bring resource materials such as books, manuals, notes and program
      listings. Contestants may not bring any machine-readable versions of
      software or data. Contestants may neither bring their own computers,
      computer terminals and calculators nor any kind of communication
      devices such as radio sets, cellular phones, pagers and PDAs.</li>
    <li>Solutions
      to problems (source programs) submitted for judging are called runs.
      Each run is judged as accepted or rejected and the team is notified of
      the result.</li>
    <li>Rejected runs will be marked as either "<strong>compile time error</strong>" or "<strong>run-time error</strong>" or "<strong>time-limit exceeded</strong>" or "<strong>wrong answer</strong>" or "<strong>contest rule violation</strong>."</li>
    <li>A
      contestant may submit a claim of ambiguity or error in a problem
      statement by submitting a clarification request to a judge. If the
      judges agree that an ambiguity or error exists, a clarification will be
      issued to all contestants.</li>
    <li>Contestants are not to
      converse with anyone except members of their own team and personnel
      designated by the regional contest director. System support staff may
      advise contestants on system-related problems such as explaining system
      error messages.</li>
    <li>The contest will be held in a
      networked environment. The network may only be used to submit
      solutions, to ask questions and to produce listings in ways designated
      by the organizers. Any other use of the network is strictly forbidden
      and results in immediate disqualification and removing from the contest
      area.</li>
    <li>While the contest is scheduled for five hours,
      the regional contest director has the authority to alter the length of
      the contest in the event of unforeseen difficulties. Should the contest
      duration be altered, every attempt will be made to notify contestants
      in a timely and uniform manner.</li>
    <li>A team may be
      disqualified by the regional contest director for any activity that
      jeopardizes the contest such as dislodging extension cords,
      unauthorized modification of contest materials (soft- or hardware),
      forbidden network activities, or distracting behavior.</li>
    <li>The contest director is solely responsible for ruling on unforeseen situations and interpreting these rules.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Scoring of the contest</h2>
<ol>
    <li>A
      problem is solved when it is accepted by the judges. The judges are
      solely responsible for accepting or rejecting submitted runs. In
      consultation with the judges, the regional contest director determines
      the winners of the regional contest. The regional contest director and
      judges are empowered to adjust for or adjudicate unforeseen events and
      conditions. Their decisions are final.</li>
    <li>Teams are
      ranked according to the most problems solved. Teams who solve the same
      number of problems are ranked by least total time. The total time is
      the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed
      for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the
      contest to the submittal of the accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes
      for every rejected run for that problem regardless of submittal time.
      There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved. In case of
      a tie, teams are ranked by the number of minutes elapsed from the
      beginning of the contest until the first correct solution was
      submitted. If the last rule does not break the tie the regional contest
      director is responsible to find a fair solution.</li>
