    <h1>General rules</h1>
    	<h2>Confirmation of eligible contestants</h2>
    <p class="paragraph"><a href="ConfirmationCERC.pdf">Confirmation form</a></p>
    	<h2>Mission</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) provides 
    college students with opportunities to interact with students from other 
    universities and to sharpen and demonstrate their problem-solving, 
    programming, and teamwork skills.&nbsp; The contest provides a platform for ACM, 
    industry, and academia to encourage and focus public attention on the next 
    generation of computing professionals as they pursue excellence.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">The contest is a two-tiered competition among teams of students 
    representing institutions of higher education. Teams first compete in <em>
    regional contests</em> held around the world from September to November each 
    year. The winning team from each regional contest qualifies to advance to 
    the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest <em>World Finals</em>, 
    typically held the following March to mid-April. Additional high-ranking 
    teams may be invited to the World Finals as <em>wild card</em> teams. </p>
	<h2>Organization</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">The ICPC International Steering Committee is responsible for establishing 
    contest rules, policy and guidelines. They oversee the conducting of 
    regional contests, resolve regional appeals, rule on international issues, 
    recommend ways to make the contest accessible and attractive to 
    international participants and review variances in regional rules.&nbsp;There are 
    two standing subcommittees, the Appeals Committee and the&nbsp; Eligibility 
    Committee.</p>
	<p class="paragraph">The ICPC is organized according to the
    <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/Info/ppgs.pdf">
    ICPC Policies and Procedures</a>. For 
    each regional contest, the Regional Contest Director (RCD) is charged with 
    executing a regional contest in accordance with the regional rules and ICPC 
    policies, procedures, and guidelines.&nbsp;Regional rules may vary to accommodate 
    differences in educational systems and host computing facilities.&nbsp; 
    Additional rules, exceptions, and other information pertaining to a specific 
    regional contest can be found at the
    <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/regionals/CERC07/" target="_top">
    Regional Contest Website</a>.&nbsp; Those rules do not 
    supersede these rules or the World Finals rules.</p>
	<h2>Localization</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">The language of the Contest is English. All written contest materials 
    will be in English. Additional languages may be used in regional contests. 
    Terms which have undefined or different meanings outside the United States 
    must be defined or redefined appropriately in that region's <em>
    Region-Specific Rules</em>. Rules may vary at the regional level to 
    accommodate these differences.</p>
    <h2>Team Composition</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">A representative of the sponsoring institution of higher education, 
    typically a faculty member, must serve as or designate the team <em>coach</em>. 
    The coach certifies the eligibility of contestants and serves as the 
    official point-of-contact with the team prior to and during contest 
    activities. A team may only have one coach.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The coach must fully register teams in the
    <a href="https://hq-icpc.baylor.edu/register/accounts/AddInstitution.jsp">
    ICPC Registration System</a> within 
    the time set by the regional rules which, for all Regional Contests, is no 
    later than the earlier date of 7 days before the contest and November 8.&nbsp; A team is not eligible to compete in 
    the regional contest until the regional contest director has accepted the 
    team in the web registration system.&nbsp; Teams failing to comply with any of 
    these requirements will be ruled ineligible to compete.&nbsp; Only registered 
    reserves may be substituted for contestants.&nbsp; Such substitutions must be 
    entered in the ICPC Registration System by the regional contest director before the contest begins.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Each team consists of three contestants who are eligible to compete in the ICPC World Finals as described under
    <a href="#Advancing">Advancing to the World Finals</a>. The team's 
    contestants must satisfy the following eligibility rules.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><strong>Contestant Eligibility Rules</strong> -  Please refer to the <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/Regionals/EligibilityDecisionTree2007.pdf">Eligibility Decision Tree</a> to more easily determine eligibility</p> 	
<strong>Basic Requirements</strong>
      <li>A student must be willing and able to compete in the World Finals.</li>
      <li>A student must be enrolled in a degree program at the sponsoring institution with at least a half-time load. This rule is not to be construed as disqualifying co-op students, exchange students, or students serving internships.</li>
	  <li>A student may compete for only one institution during a contest year.</li>
	  <li>A student who has competed in two World Finals is NOT eligible to compete.</li>
	  <li>A student who has competed in five Regional Contests is NOT eligible to compete.</li>
    </dl>
<strong>Period of Eligibility</strong>
      <li>A student who meets the Basic Requirements and  FIRST began post-secondary studies in <font color="#FF0000">2003</font> or later is eligible to compete.</li>
      <li>A student who meets the Basic Requirements and was born in <font color="#FF0000">1984</font> or later is eligible to compete.</li>	
	  </dl>
<strong>Extending the Period of Eligibility</strong>
      <li>A coach may petition the <a href="mailto:manager@icpc.baylor.edu?subject=Contestant Extension of Eligibility">ICPC Eligibility Committee</a> to extend the Period of Eligibility for a student whose full-time studies have been interrupted or extended. This includes military or civilian service, illness, work/studies, or personal reasons.</li>
      <li>The coach must demonstrate that such an extension would not provide an unfair advantage to the team.</li>
	  <li>A petition will be approved routinely if the student meets the Basic Requirements and has not completed more than the equivalent of eight semesters of full-time study as of the date of the regional contest.</li>
	  <li>To make such a request, the coach must petition the <a href="mailto:manager@icpc.baylor.edu?subject=Contestant Extension of Eligibility">ICPC Eligibility Committee</a> at least three weeks before the regional contest. The ICPC Eligibility Committee will render a decision within five business days.</li>	
	  </dl>
    <h2>Where to Compete</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Each team is expected to compete only within its defined region. However, a team with a valid reason (e.g. driving distance) may 
request to compete in a different region for a given year. The 
team coach must submit such a request to the 
    <a href="mailto:manager@icpc.baylor.edu?subject=Request to Move to a Different Region">Director of Regional Contests</a> 
    (DRC), who will approve the request only if the decision is unanimous among all affected Directors.</p>
<p class="paragraph">An institution may send contestants to only one regional contest in a given year.</p>
<h2>Regional Contest Attendance</h2>
<p class="paragraph">All team members must attend all contest activities as specified by the regional contest director for that region. The coach is expected to attend or be available by phone during contest activities.  Failure to attend any of the designated contest events will result in automatic disqualification and forfeiture of any scholarships and prizes.</p>
<h2>Conduct of a Regional Contest</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Solutions to problems submitted for judging are called <em>runs</em>. 
    Each run is judged as accepted or rejected by a <em>judge</em>, and the team 
    is notified of the results.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Notification of accepted runs may be suspended at an appropriate time to 
    keep the final results secret. A general announcement to that effect will be 
    made during the contest. Notification of rejected runs will continue until 
    the end of the contest.</p>
<p class="paragraph">A contestant may submit a claim of ambiguity or error in a problem 
    statement by submitting a <em>clarification request</em> to a judge. If the 
    judges agree that an ambiguity or error exists, a <em>clarification</em> 
    will be issued to all contestants.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Contestants are not to converse with anyone except members of their team 
    and personnel designated by the regional contest director. Systems support 
    staff may advise contestants on system-related problems such as explaining 
    system error messages.</p>
<p class="paragraph">While the contest is scheduled for a particular time length (typically 
    five hours), the regional contest director has the authority to alter the 
    length of the contest in the event of unforeseen difficulties. Should the 
    contest duration be altered, every attempt will be made to notify 
    contestants in a timely and uniform manner.</p>
<p class="paragraph">A team may be disqualified by the regional contest director for any 
    activity that jeopardizes the contest such as dislodging extension cords, 
    unauthorized modification of contest materials, or distracting behavior.</p>
<p class="paragraph">At least six problems will be posed. So far as possible, problems will 
    avoid dependence on detailed knowledge of a particular applications area or 
    particular contest language.</p>		
<h2>Scoring of a Regional Contest</h2>
<p class="paragraph">A problem is solved when it is accepted by the judges.&nbsp; The judges are 
    solely responsible for accepting or rejecting submitted runs. In 
    consultation with the judges, the Regional Contest Director determines the 
    winners of the regional contest. The regional contest director and judges 
    are empowered to adjust for or adjudicate unforeseen events and conditions. 
    Their decisions are final.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Teams are ranked according to the most problems solved. For the purposes 
    of awards, or in determining qualifier(s) for the World Finals, teams who 
    solve the same number of problems are ranked by least total time. The total 
    time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time 
    consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the 
    contest to the submittal of the accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for 
    every rejected run for that problem regardless of submittal time. There is 
    no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.</p>	
<p class="paragraph">It is the responsibility of the Regional Contest Director to specify any 
    additional tie-breakers. Tie-breaker policies must be announced to 
    contestants before the contest begins.</p>	
<h2>Regional Contest Computing Environment</h2>
<p class="paragraph">The programming languages of the regional contest will include C/C++. 
Additional programming languages may be used. The programming languages of the World Finals are Java 
and C/C++.&nbsp; Prior to the World Finals, the judges will have solved all 
problems in Java and C/C++.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Each team will use a single workstation. The regional 
    contest director is responsible for determining that teams have reasonably 
    equivalent computing resources.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Each Regional Contest Director determines whether contestants may bring 
    materials for use during the contest.&nbsp; Please see the specific regional 
    rules at the <u>
    <a href="trules.html">
    ICPC Regional Contest Web Site</a></u>. 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;At the World Finals, no printed materials or electronic devices may be 
    brought into the contest area.&nbsp; On-line reference materials will be made 
    available as described at the
    <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/Finals/reference.htm">

    ICPC World Finals Reference Materials Site</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each team 
    will be permitted to provide a PDF of up to 25 pages of notes within the 
    limits described during Team Certification.&nbsp; Three copies will be printed 
    and placed at the team's workstation for use during the World Finals.</p>	
<h2>Complaints, Appeals, and Remedies</h2>
<p class="paragraph">If irregularities or misconduct are observed during the contest, team 
    members or coaches should bring them to the attention of the contest 
    officials so that action may be taken as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="paragraph">After the conclusion of the contest and 
        the results have been made public, coaches may file complaints or 
        appeals as follows:</p>
