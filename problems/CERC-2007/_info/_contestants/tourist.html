  <h1>Travel Information</h1>
  <p>Most of you will travel to Prague by plane.
    International flights arrive at the <a href="http://www.prg.aero/en/site/klient/sluzby_kontakty/informace_letiste_praha.htm" target="_blank">Prague International Airport</a>, Ruzyne, <b>PRG</b>.</p>
  <h2>From Airport to Hotels</h2>
  <p>There are three basic means of transport you may choose from.</p>

  <h3>Taxi</h3>
  <p>Cabs are expensive in Prague, especially those at the airport.
    The price depends on a company -- expect a price of about 500-800 CZK
    (approx. $15-30) or even more for one ride to the city center.
    Moreover, if a&nbsp;typical team consisting of 4 persons come, their
    baggage will hardly fit into a&nbsp;single car. <a href="tourist.html#taxi">More info on taxi services.</a></p>
  <h3>Public Transport</h3>
  <p>Public transportation system runs very well in Prague. It is the
    cheapest mean of transport, of course. You do not need to worry,
    it is quite common in Europe to use public transports. One ride from the
    Airport to the city center will cost you 20 CZK including a ticket for
    your baggage. <a href="tourist.html#mhd">More info on the public transport.</a></p>

  <h1>Transportation in Prague</h1>
  <p>This page summarizes basic info on different kinds of transport in Prague,
    how to use them, what to be aware of, etc.</p>
  <p><span class="red">Note to pedestrians:</span> According to a law, all cars
    (except trams!) must yield to pedestrians on crosswalks. Anyway, if you walk,
    please <em>do not rely</em> on this. It is a relatively new law, people still
    did not get used to it and many drivers violate it! Always be careful when
    you cross a street.</p>
  <a name="mhd"></a>
  <h2>Public Transport</h2>
  <p>Public transportation system is the cheapest mean of transport
    (beside walking on foot). You do not need to worry to use it,
    it is quite common in Europe to use public transports.</p>
  <p>The Prague public transport consists of a subway system ("metro"),
    streetcars ("trams"), and buses. There is also one scenic funicular line to
    the hill of Petrin (unfortunately out of order for maintenance at this
    time).</p>
  <h3>Tickets</h3>
  <p>If you want to use the public transport, you have to buy a ticket in
    advance, prior to getting into a vehicle or metro area.</p>
  <p>The same tickets are valid for all types of vehicles (metro, tram, bus,
    funicular). 
	
	You may buy one-ride ticket (20 CZK), 1-day ticket (80 CZK),
    3-day ticket (220 CZK), one-week ticket (280 CZK), or even
    15-day ticket (320 CZK).</p>
  <p>The one-ride ticket is valid for 60 minutes on bussiness days and for 90
    minutes on weekends. Within this time period, you may change lines as you
    wish. There is also a special 14 CZK ticket for short rides, it is valid for
    15 minutes in a single vehicle without changing (buses and trams) or for 4
    stations (metro).</p>
  <p>If you have a&nbsp;piece of baggage larger than 25cm x 45cm x 70cm
    (you <em>will</em> have it when travelling from the airport),
    additional ticket for the baggage is required, which costs
    10 CZK.</p>
  <p>Detailed information on the public transport system, including
    all fares, can be found at <a href="http://www.dpp.cz/en/index.htm" target="_blank">Prague Public Transit Co.</a> web page. You can see there also pictures of the tickets.</p>
  <h3>Contest Hotels</h3>
  <p>To get to the contest area, use metro line "A" (the green one) to go to
    the stop called "Dejvicka".
     </span></p>
  <p>If you travel from the airport, you need to take the bus Nr. 119 first.
    It will take you to "Dejvicka" station (it is the terminal stop of the bus).
  </p>

  <a name="taxi"></a>
  <h2>Cabs (taxi)</h2>
  <p>Cabs are very expensive in Prague and the drivers often try to abuse
    foreigners' lack of information to get more money. Thing you should know
    before you go by a cab:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Every cab car must have a price written on the doors. The price will
      usually consist of two parts: some fixed amount (typically about 40 CZK,
      i.e., 1,5 EUR) and a price per one kilometer (25-30 CZK, i.e., 1 EUR). </span></li>
    <li>The cab must have a taximeter inside, displaying the current price in
      CZK during the whole ride. Although some drivers will turn it off at the
      beginning or during the ride, it is illegal to do so. Theoretically, you
      should pay just the amount shown at the display.</li>
    <li>You can ask the driver to give you an estimate of the total cost
      in advance, based on your target place.</li>
    <li>If possible, do not stop cabs directly on the street. It is much better
      to call a taxi dispatcher and tell them your position. The drivers that work
      for large companies usually behave very well, since they are under
      control. Moreover, the price is usually much lower if you call the cab by
      phone.</li>
    <li>Credit cars are rarely accepted in cabs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>List of some radio-control taxi services follows. Disclaimer: we are not
    recommending any of these, we just found the phone numbers in a directory.
    We can take no responsibilities for anything.</p>

  <h1>Money Information</h1>
  <h2>Currency</h2>
  <p>The Czech Republic has its own currency, <b>Czech Crown</b> (CZK).
    Its local name is "koruna ceska", you may see the abbreviation "Kc"
    in shops etc. One hundredth of the crown is called "haler".</p>
  <p><b>Euro</b> currency is not used in the Czech Republic, although
    there are some shops and stores that accept euros. Such stores
    are still exceptional. However, there are many exchange offices
    in Prague which accept major currencies, such as U.S. dollars
    and euros.</p>
  <p>The <b>exchange rate</b> is approximately 27 CZK for 1 euro, or
    22 CZK for 1 U.S. dollar. You can find exact rates (daily updated)
    at the <a
href="http://www.cnb.cz/en/financial_markets/foreign_exchange_market/exchange_rate_fixing/daily.jsp" target="_blank">Czech National Bank</a> web page. Please note that these are mean
    exchange rates for bank purposes. Thus, count on receiving a little
    less crowns for your money in exchange offices (they want to profit,
    of course).</p>
  <p><b>Banknotes</b> and coins: There are 0.5 CZK (50 haler), 1 CZK,
    2 CZK, 5 CZK, 10 CZK, 20 CZK, and 50 CZK coins and 20 CZK, 50 CZK,
    100 CZK, 200 CZK, 500 CZK, 1000 CZK, 2000 CZK, and 5000 CZK banknotes.
    The pictures of them can be seen at the <a href="http://www.cnb.cz/en/czech_legal_tender/banknotes" target="_blank">Czech National Bank</a> web page. There is also a description of protective elements.</p>
  <p><span class="red">Note:</span> 0.1 CZK (10 haler) and 0.2 CZK (20 haler)
    coins were in use until several year ago. Nowadays, they are not valid
    anymore and the smallest coin is half-crown. Anyway, the prices in shops are
    often given in tenths of CZK. In this case, they are sumed together and the
    total price of the purchase is then rounded to the nearest 0.5 CZK value.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Credit Cards</h2>
  <p>Major international <b>credit cards</b> are widely accepted,
    especially Visa and EuroCard/MasterCard. American Express and
    Diners' Club are rarely seen, do not rely on them. There are also
    many shops and restaurants that do not accept some or any cards.
    Please always check for Visa or EC/MC logo at the door.</p>
  <p>There are plenty of <b>ATM</b>s in Prague city center, thus,
    it should be no problem to get some cash. The ATMs usually accept
    Visa and EC/MC (watch for logos again). Anyway, it could be quite
    expensive to use ATMs. Check with your card issuer if you want to
    know exact charges.</p>

  <h1>Security in Prague</h1>
  <h2>Criminality</h2>
  <p>Prague is a relatively safe town. You do not need to worry there,
    nobody will rob you with pistols in the streets. Anyway, there <em>are</em> pocket thieves in Prague, as in other big cities all over the world. <span class="red">Please take care of your personal things all the
    time!</span> Do not carry your passport and/or money in the pocket of
    your knapsack, back pocket of your pants, or in other easily accessible
    places. Never leave your things unattended, even for a few seconds.</p>
  <h2>Cabs</h2>
  <p>Taxi drivers often try to abuse foreigners' lack of information.
    If you intend to use a taxi, read our <a href="tourist.html#taxi">transportation info</a> page for more details, 
    there are some advices for you.</p>

  <h1>Czech Language</h1>
  <p>People in the Czech Republic speak their own language, the Czech. Many
    people in Prague speak English or German, especially young people. Try to
    ask them if you need something.</p>
  <p>It is very hard (almost impossible) to learn Czech for foreigners, because
    the language is very difficult (more difficult than Latin or German, for
    example). This page gives you some basic vocabulary to read various signs
    and to say very simple things.</p>
